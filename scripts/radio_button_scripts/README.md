# Radio Fill Bookmarklet
## About
Auto-fill out radio-buttons and text areas on https://staging-isp.osf.io/survey
These scripts require you to put them in a bookmarklet in order for them to work. You can paste them into the console, but this will break some functionality.

## Google Chrome

* Click on Bookmarks
* Click on Bookmark Manager
* Right click in the Organize section
* Click Add Page
* Name the bookmark whatever you like it, ie: 'radio button filler'
* Copy and paste the contents of 'radio_button_bookmarklet.js' into the url section
* Optional: Add the bookmarklet to your bookmark bar


## Instructions
* When on a page with radio buttons you would like to fill, or text areas to fill, click on the bookmarklet and let it work.
* You will still have to manually fill out drag and drop sections

## Known Problems

#### Drop Down Menus
* Drop down menus do not work with this script, and you will have to fill them out manually.
