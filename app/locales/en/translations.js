High scorers tend to be well liked by their peers, and they establish satisfying and stable close relationships. They are more likely to be religious, to serve in community leadership roles, and to do volunteer work. Older adults tend to score higher than younger adults.",

High scorers tend to earn higher grades in school, and perform better in many occupations. They are more likely to be religious and hold conservative political attitudes. They tend to exercise more, have better physical health, and live longer. Older adults tend to score higher than younger adults.",

High scorers tend to have more friends and dating partners, and are seen as more popular. They are more likely to serve in community leadership roles, and to do volunteer work. They tend to prefer energetic music, exercise more frequently, and are more likely to play a sport. They experience more frequent positive emotions, and react more strongly to positive events.",

        "loConsc": "Low scorers tend to act spontaneously rather than making plans, and find it easier to look at the big picture than pay attention to details. They prefer to jump between tasks, instead of finishing one at a time. They tend to engage in more risky behaviors, such as smoking, alcohol consumption, and drug use.",
        "loExtra": "Low scorers tend to be socially and emotionally reserved. They generally prefer to be alone or with a few close friends, and keep their opinions and feelings to themselves. They are less likely to engage in thrill-seeking activities or risky behaviors such as smoking and alcohol consumption.",
