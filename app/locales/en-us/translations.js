Placing an item in the highest (right-hand) category indicates that the item is \u201cextremely characteristic\u201d of the situation. Only three cards can go into this category, so they should be the best descriptors. Putting an item in the middle categories means that the item is irrelevant to the situation, or that you are unsure of where the item belongs. Putting an item in the lowest (right-hand) category implies that the item is \u201cextremely uncharacteristic\u201d of the situation. Again, only three cards can go into this category so they should be the items that are the very LEAST characteristic. A fixed number of items goes into each box. You can drag and drop items from one box to another, but if you leave too many items in any one box, the heading will turn red. The heading will turn green when the right number of items is in the box."
